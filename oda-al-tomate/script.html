<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>What if I told you that a poem about tomatoes is actually discussing the downfall of Chile&#39;s political system? <em>Oda al Tomate</em> by Pablo Neruda is a Chilean poem written in the mid-1950s. The poem follows a tomato from the streets of Chile into a kitchen, where it is prepared for a lunchtime meal. On the surface, it is a fairly simple, somewhat dull poem, but the meaning beneath the surface is far from it. </p>
<h2 id="poem-breakdown">Poem Breakdown</h2>
<p>&quot;The street is full of tomatoes. Midday, summer&quot;. This is the powerful opening line of <em>Oda al Tomate</em>, immediately setting the scene. You can see it, can&#39;t you? Market stalls lining the street, sellers shouting their wares and endless hoards of tomatoes. Neruda uses subtle messaging here to introduce the importance of the tomato into Chilean culture, which is used to link the tomato and Chile. The tomato is then used to symbolise Chile throughout the rest of the poem. </p>
<p>&quot;The tomato invades the kitchen&quot;. Throughout <em>Oda al Tomate</em>, Neruda uses incredibly descriptive and specific language, which is not used without reason. I believe that the use of &quot;invade&quot; is Neruda making reference to the invasion of the Spanish empire in the mid-1500s, which set up a large part of modern Chile&#39;s culture. The next part of the poem describes the tomato (or Chile) taking its place among the kitchen benches (the land) and other ingredients (other cultures). </p>
<p>Suddenly, the poem takes a turn. &quot;Unfortunately, we must murder it. The knife sinks into living flesh&quot;. Neruda is expressing his regret with Chile and how he believes the country is dying. At the time of writing <em>Oda al Tomate</em>, Neruda was exiled from Chile after his political party betrayed him. I think Neruda saw this as his ex-political party &quot;murdering&quot; Chile, by shifting from a communist regime to a democratic one. Here, Neruda is calling out what he sees as an unstable the political landscape is in Chile and asks people to see it from his point of view. </p>
<p>Neruda then launches into the preparation of the tomato. He talks about &quot;marrying&quot; the tomato and the onion, with the addition of some smaller ingredients for flavour. Neruda is referencing the &quot;melting pot&quot; culture of Chile: ~25% of the population has European ancestry, 65% is European-Indigenous, ~7% Indigenous, with a large community of Palestinian and American Indians. Placing these lines directly after the &quot;murder&quot; of Chile shows how Neruda believes that Chile must unite (as it did in the past) in order to survive politically, much as tomato unites with onion and lettuce in a salad. This is cemented by the lines &quot;parley hoists its flag&quot;, as Chile can only &quot;hoist its flag&quot; once the country is united. </p>
<p>Finally, the poem transitions into its climax, where Neruda talks about the tomato and its near perfection. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>and, on
the table, at the midpoint
of summer,
the tomato,
star of earth,
recurrent
and fertile
star,
displays
its convolutions,
its canals,
its remarkable amplitude
and abundance,
no pit,
no husk,
no leaves or thorns,
the tomato offers
its gift
of fiery color
and cool completeness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the final time, we can see the symbolism of Chile in the tomato. Being such a long, skinny country, Chile experiences many different climates: the dry deserts of north, fertile land of the middle and chilly climate of the south, the Andes mountains, etc. Neruda, despite how he perceives Chile&#39;s tumultuous status, still loves the country for all it has, so he decides to end the poem on a high note. </p>
<h2 id="deeper-meaning-and-literary-techniques">Deeper Meaning and Literary Techniques</h2>
<p>Whilst it seems quite a happy, exciting poem on the surface, <em>Oda al Tomate</em> dives deep into political and social issues that Neruda believes plague Chile. The reason that Neruda covers this so effectively is through his symbolism and personification of Chile. Alongside Chile&#39;s symbolism, Neruda personifies Chile through the &quot;marriage&quot; of the ingredients, suggesting that Chile can do things anyone can. It helps ground the poem and makes Chile seem like a living, breathing entity. </p>
<p>A second impact on the reader is Neruda&#39;s use of imagery. Throughout the play, Neruda uses highly descriptive language to paint a picture, with the reader being able to clearly see each scene. Using specific wording like &quot;magnetism&quot;, &quot;takes its ease&quot; and &quot;halved hemispheres&quot;, Neruda knows that the reader will imagine the exact image he wants. </p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The final impact of Neruda&#39;s poem is the structure. Each line of the poem only uses <em>at maximum</em> four words, most lines having three or two, and some lines only having one. Having such short lines forces the reader&#39;s eyes to fly down the page, creating a sense of rapid pace and excitement. Combined with Neruda&#39;s heavily descriptive language, the poem creates a sense of tension at intense moments and effectively draws in the reader. </p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-matter-">Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>So why does any of this stuff matter? The boring answer is &quot;It broadens our understanding of wold culture by seeing different perspectives&quot;, which is true. However, it isn&#39;t interesting. What&#39;s more interesting is the societal issues that are brought up by these pieces. </p>
<p>Poetry, like other forms of media, is created for a purpose: to have an idea stick in someone&#39;s head for as long as possible. Media is (more often than not) created to convince someone of an idea or a philosophy, and Neruda is no exception. When reading <em>Oda al Tomate</em>, the reader is thinking about Chile and its less than ideal political landscape over the last century and a half. The reader then might think about today&#39;s less than ideal political landscapes. I&#39;m not pointing fingers, but Russia&#39;s <em>totally a democracy</em> and Australia&#39;s sigma senators sound like they have a few issues. This, ironically, ties back into the boring answer (&quot;different perspectives&quot;), but it goes to show how poems written over 70 years ago can still have an impact on our thought process today. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>Oda al Tomate</em> by Pablo Neruda is an interesting poem. Seeing past the tomato cult, Neruda covers heavy political issues and asks the world to stop and consider the problems at hand. He uses effective literary techniques, such as personification and symbolic messaging, and combines it with a unique poetic structure to keep the reader engaged throughout. Overall: 8/10, would eat here again. </p>
