### Analysis: High school student lands crushing blow against news.com.au; commercial media

*Eye-opening presentation reveals how the media has become swamped with "good enough" journalism*
##### By Liam O'Connor

notes: "The 2025 federal election covered many issues, but none so prevalent as the housing crisis, a topic of practically endless debate. Throughout the election cycle it has been covered by media from the left, right and centre, though it quickly becomes apparent that some sources are better than others."

*Above: Alan Kohler (1)*

notes: - Introduce Alan Kohler
- He works for ABC news as an economist
- Frequently reporting on the housing crisis
- A very well respected, centrist reporter and analyst
- Can be argued that, since he primarily works for ABC news, he is government-funded

*Above: news.com.au logo (2)*

notes: - A well-rounded example of commercial media
- Writes independently as well as supporting other outlets
- Very popular
- Allegedly beating ABC news in month-to-month internet traffic comparisons
- Leans right; more centrist than other Murdoch media

"These two outlets can be summarised with two slightly different statements."

##### Alan Kohler
# Neutral to the point of boring

notes: - Kohler is "neutral to the point of boring"
- Presents multiple viewpoints, not just the main parties
- Equally distributes criticism

##### news.com.au
# Nothing more, nothing less
#####

notes: "On the other hand, news.com.au presents nothing less then what they need to, but nothing more that could be of value to their audience."

- Often just presents the talking points and policies of each party

##### *Reports on policies, though little analysis (4)*

notes: "...an article wrapping up each party policy in preparation for an election just a few days out. Unlike Kohler, news.com.au articles usually lack a hard-driven angle of solution-finding, and read more like a tasteless, unoriginal parrot of what the major parties want you to believe."

"Unfortunately, for the articles that *do* include a more original angle, news.com.au seems to disregard quality even more so."

## "A culture war imported from America"
\- Prof. Matthew Ricketson (6)

notes: "Firstly, a focus on what Ricketson has called a 'culture war imported from America', at a time when Australian's aren't concerned with these issues. The Murdoch media is notorious for attempting to bring topics like immigration out of the sphere of consensus, and news.com.au is no exception."

##### *A non-existent culture war (7)*

notes: "These are two examples of such behaviour, with one article being an opinion piece from Sky News, and the other an in-house piece, both claiming that the housing crisis is primarily caused by immigration."

- The in-house article is a bit more tame than the Sky News piece
- Not covering the whole truth

"Now hold onto that thought, because we'll come back to that in a bit."

###### (9)

notes: - Two examples of news.com.au bringing in more "clickbait" headlines

###### (10)

notes: - The entire article only uses one source
- Reads similar to other stories on news.com.au
- Slightly tasteless
- Parroting the experts instead of properly analysing
- Weaker article
- Lower quality news source

##### news.com.au
# Advertising triumphs all
##### *The Manufacturing Consent model*

notes: "... advertising triumphs all. News.com.au is ultimately a for-profit company, and that means that they are eventually beholden to the whims of the stakeholders, and the advertisers."

- Falls under Noam Chompsky's model of manufacturing consent
- Headlines are clickbait-y to encourage more people to click
- It's quicker to simply repeat what other people say rather than make your own analysis
- Immigration is included to cater to their reader base, which is more right wing, in the hopes of building a loyal, rather than informed audience
- It's nothing more, nothing less

##### *Presenting the facts: an Active Audience (11)*

notes: "Kohler doesn't have to build a loyal audience through agreement, he builds an informed audience that trusts him as a reputable news source, which is far better for the public than news.com.au's echo chambers."

- Kohler believes in an active audience, who votes with their feet
- Always attempts to leave them informed

"Kohler can do this because, ironically, he's..."

##### *An economist unconcerned with money (12)*

notes: "... an economist unconcerned with money."

- Most of his income is taxpayer-funded
- Doesn't have to worry about appealing to advertisers or shareholders and can get stuck in to reporting

"He can get a lot closer to the truth than any commercial media could, simply because he has less barriers to overcome before publishing a story."

## In defence of commercial media

*It's not necessarily bad journalism*

notes: - It's not malicious journalism or evil journalism, and it's not terrible journalism either, but it's just not the same as Kohler.

# Conclusion

notes: 

- Neutral to the point of boring
- Nothing more, nothing less
- Manufacturing Consent
- Active Audience
- Kohler is simply better journalism

"Unfortunately for news.com.au, unless they make fundamental shifts in their business model and how they operate, they probably won't catch up to Kohler any time soon. This has been Liam O'Connor, Noteworthy News, Canberra."
