<p>“The 2025 federal election covered many issues, but none so
prevalent as the housing crisis, a topic of practically endless debate.
Throughout the election cycle it has been covered by media from the
left, right and centre, though it quickly becomes apparent that some
sources are better than others.”</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Introduce Alan Kohler</li>
<li>He works for ABC news as an economist</li>
<li>Frequently reporting on the housing crisis</li>
<li>A very well respected, centrist reporter and analyst</li>
<li>Can be argued that, since he primarily works for ABC news, he is
government-funded</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>A well-rounded example of commercial media</li>
<li>Writes independently as well as supporting other outlets</li>
<li>Very popular</li>
<li>Allegedly beating ABC news in month-to-month internet traffic
comparisons</li>
<li>Leans right; more centrist than other Murdoch media</li>
</ul>
<p>“These two outlets can be summarised with two slightly different
statements.”</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Kohler is “neutral to the point of boring”</li>
<li>Presents multiple viewpoints, not just the main parties</li>
<li>Equally distributes criticism</li>
</ul>
<p>(more notes on next slide)</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Weighs the upsides and downsides of each solution</li>
<li>Gives all the facts to the audience</li>
<li>Uncontroversial analysis and reports in a way that could be passed
off as “boring”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>“On the other hand, news.com.au presents nothing less then what they
need to, but nothing more that could be of value to their audience.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Often just presents the talking points and policies of each
party</li>
</ul>
<p>“as seen in this example…”</p>
<hr />
<p>“…an article wrapping up each party policy in preparation for an
election just a few days out. Unlike Kohler, news.com.au articles
usually lack a hard-driven angle of solution-finding, and read more like
a tasteless, unoriginal parrot of what the major parties want you to
believe.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, for the articles that <em>do</em> include a more
original angle, news.com.au seems to disregard quality even more
so.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“This is Matthew Ricktson, a professor in communications and
journalism at Deakin University in Melbourne. Ricketson recently covered
some of the problems facing the Murdoch media, including news.com.au, of
which two criticisms are of note to this argument.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“Firstly, a focus on what Ricketson has called a ‘culture war
imported from America’, at a time when Australian’s aren’t concerned
with these issues. The Murdoch media is notorious for attempting to
bring topics like immigration out of the sphere of consensus, and
news.com.au is no exception.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“These are two examples of such behaviour, with one article being an
opinion piece from Sky News, and the other an in-house piece, both
claiming that the housing crisis is primarily caused by
immigration.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The in-house article is a bit more tame than the Sky News piece</li>
<li>Not covering the whole truth</li>
</ul>
<p>“Now hold onto that thought, because we’ll come back to that in a
bit.”</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>To “maximise their audience”, media companies have toned down on
factual reporting and increased opinion pieces</li>
<li>With the media having to get “shoutier and shoutier”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Two examples of news.com.au bringing in more “clickbait”
headlines</li>
<li>Harsher word tone</li>
<li>Making something out of nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>“That first article is actually one of note, so let’s have a closer
look at that one.”</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>The entire article only uses one source</li>
<li>Reads similar to other stories on news.com.au</li>
<li>Slightly tasteless</li>
<li>Parroting the experts instead of properly analysing</li>
<li>Weaker article</li>
<li>Lower quality news source</li>
</ul>
<p>“All of these problems can be explained with one simple
realisation…”</p>
<hr />
<p>“… advertising triumphs all. News.com.au is ultimately a for-profit
company, and that means that they are eventually beholden to the whims
of the stakeholders, and the advertisers.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Falls under Noam Chompsky’s model of manufacturing consent</li>
<li>Headlines are clickbait-y to encourage more people to click</li>
<li>It’s quicker to simply repeat what other people say rather than make
your own analysis</li>
<li>Immigration is included to cater to their reader base, which is more
right wing, in the hopes of building a loyal, rather than informed
audience</li>
<li>It’s nothing more, nothing less</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>“Kohler doesn’t have to build a loyal audience through agreement, he
builds an informed audience that trusts him as a reputable news source,
which is far better for the public than news.com.au’s echo
chambers.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Kohler believes in an active audience, who votes with their
feet</li>
<li>Always attempts to leave them informed</li>
</ul>
<p>“Kohler can do this because, ironically, he’s…”</p>
<hr />
<p>“… an economist unconcerned with money.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of his income is taxpayer-funded</li>
<li>Doesn’t have to worry about appealing to advertisers or shareholders
and can get stuck in to reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>“He can get a lot closer to the truth than any commercial media
could, simply because he has less barriers to overcome before publishing
a story.”</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>It’s not malicious journalism or evil journalism, and it’s not
terrible journalism either, but it’s just not the same as Kohler.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Neutral to the point of boring</li>
<li>Nothing more, nothing less</li>
<li>Manufacturing Consent</li>
<li>Active Audience</li>
<li>Kohler is simply better journalism</li>
</ul>
<p>“Unfortunately for news.com.au, unless they make fundamental shifts
in their business model and how they operate, they probably won’t catch
up to Kohler any time soon. This has been Liam O’Connor, Noteworthy
News, Canberra.”</p>
