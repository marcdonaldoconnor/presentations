# Children's Theatre

###### A BRIEF OVERVIEW

notes: Storytelling as a medium of conveying information has been around for thousands of years. The first known example of storytelling through pictures is a cave painting in Indonesia, which has been dated to nearly 44,000 years ago! It is no wonder then, that theatre, another form of storytelling, has been in existence for over two-and-a-half thousand years. However, over this rather long period of time, no theatre specific to children has been developed until the last 130 years.

## VISUAL THEATRE?

notes: Theatre has four key elements: actors, space, audience and an idea. These are the fundamental underpinnings of all forms of theatre.

Visual theatre is the use of different techniques and other arts such as dance, music, puppetry, multimedia, movement, etc. to create...

## 1960s "Big Boom" Era

notes: influential theatre companies (some of which still operate today) are formed around the globe, such as the Australian Theatre for Young People in 1963 and Polka Theatre, a popular children's theatre in the United Kingdom, in 1967. This sudden explosion for children's theatre came about for the same reason as in 1923: the desire to educate young people in political ideology, this time at the height of the Cold War.

###### *Belgrade, Performance for Babies* (7)

notes: Today, Theatre for Young People is still used as a tool for awareness, often discussing political, social and cultural issues in a way that does not directly confront an audience. In the last 30-odd years, the general attitude around children's theatre has greatly shifted from being considered a "lesser form of theatre" to being on par or even more important that theatre for adults. As children's theatre has evolved over the last century, and visual theatre has matured for the last 90 years, a modern production would look a lot more like this clip from The Life of Pi:

## MY EXPERIENCE
##### WITH VISUAL THEATRE

notes: In a modern children's theatre, the biggest problem that amateur actors like myself face is the lack of utilising physical movements to produce character, and instead relying on dialogue to push a narrative forward. In future work, I would really like to try incorporating more abstract styles of movement such as dance to really emphasise my characters and bring a personality to them, outside of just what they say to other characters or the audience. Additionally, I have not previously performed in any kind of musical, and so I look forward to integrating musical effects into my work in the near future, simply for the experience of trying something new.

# CONCLUSION

notes: Whilst children's theatre has had a rocky journey into the public eye, riddled with political and social motivations, today it holds it's place as a respected art form. Following in it's roots, it is still used today to raise awareness to political, social and cultural issues without confronting an audience directly. Thanks to the formation of international organisations such as ASSITEJ International, children's theatre is now a common staple around the world and serves as an entry point into the world of theatre, inspiring young people on the issues that are of importance to them and pushing society forward. Thank you.
